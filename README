Dependencies:
    * VLfeat (http://www.vlfeat.org/)
        
    * FastEdgeDetection
        ( http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/downloads/389109f6-b4e8-404c-84bf-239f7cbf4e3d/ )
        "Structured Forests for Fast Edge Detection", P. Doll√°r and C. Zitnick, ICCV13
    
    * Piotr's Computer Vision MATLAB Toolbox
        ( http://vision.ucsd.edu/~pdollar/toolbox/doc/index.html )
    
    * Accurate fast marching toolbox
        ( http://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/24531-accurate-fast-marching )
    
    * Graph Based Image Segmentation
        ( http://cs.brown.edu/~pff/segment/ )
        "Efficient Graph-Based Image Segmentation" P. Felzenszwalb, D. Huttenlocher, IJCV04
        Note that their package is C++ only. Our package provides a MATLAB wrapper.

    * Recursive Bilateral Filtering
        ( http://www.cs.cityu.edu.hk/~qiyang/publications/eccv-12/ )
        "Recursive Bilateral Filtering", Q. Yang, ECCV12
        Their code is a bit restrictive, e.g. in that input cannot have two channels (like flow does).
        Our version can filter two-channel images (as a special case), and also includes a MATLAB wrapper.

You must run "mex_setup.m" in cdo_aid/ prior to anything
